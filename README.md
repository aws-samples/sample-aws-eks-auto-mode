## Prerequisites

🛠️ **Required Tools**
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

> **Note**: This project currently provides Linux-specific commands in the examples. Windows compatibility will be added in future updates.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone Repository**:
```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-eks-auto-mode.git
cd sample-aws-eks-auto-mode

# Configure remote
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-eks-auto-mode.git
```

2. **Deploy Cluster**:
```bash
# Navigate to Terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialize and apply Terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Configure kubectl
$(terraform output -raw configure_kubectl)
```

## Components

### 🔄 NodePools
EKS Auto Mode leverages [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/docs/) for intelligent node management:

⚡ **Auto-scaling Features**
- Dynamic node provisioning
- Workload-aware scaling
- Resource optimization

📦 **Preconfigured NodePools**
In these samples we configure the following Nodepools for you:
- ARM64-optimized Graviton nodes
- EC2 Spot nodes
- GPU-accelerated compute nodes
- Inferentia2 ML inference nodes

> 📘 **Note**: Check [NodePool Templates](/nodepool-templates) for detailed configurations.


### 🛠️ NodeClass Configuration
EKS Auto Mode uses [NodeClass](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-class.html) for granular control over infrastructure-level settings:

⚙️ **Customization Options**
- Subnet selection for node placement
- Security group configuration
- Ephemeral storage settings
- Network policies and SNAT configuration
- Custom tagging for resource management

📦 **Implementation Approach**
In these samples, we create a custom NodeClass for each example workload type:
- Each NodeClass is defined in the same file as its corresponding NodePool
- Custom NodeClasses are only needed for specific infrastructure customizations
- For most use cases, the default NodeClass works best with EKS Auto Mode

> ⚠️ **Important**: When creating custom NodeClasses, be aware of these considerations:
> - If you change the Node IAM Role, you'll need to create a new Access Entry
> - Custom NodeClasses may require additional configuration to work properly with EKS Auto Mode
> - Do not name your custom NodeClass "default" as this is reserved

### 🌐 Load Balancer Configuration
EKS Auto Mode automates load balancer setup with AWS best practices:

1. 🔹 **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
   - IngressClass-based configuration
   - [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/auto-configure-alb.html)
   - Example: [2048 Game Ingress](/examples/graviton/2048-ingress.yaml)

2. 🔸 **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
   - Native Kubernetes service integration
   - [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/auto-configure-nlb.html)
   - Example: [GPU Web UI Service](/examples/gpu/lb-service.yaml)

> **Important**: If subnet IDs are not specified in IngressClassParams, AWS requires specific tags on subnets for proper load balancer functionality:
> - Public subnets: `kubernetes.io/role/elb: "1"`
> - Private subnets: `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb: "1"`
> 
> Our Terraform code automatically creates these necessary subnet tags, but you may need to add them manually if using custom networking configurations.

#### 🌍 Public exposure (opt-in)

By default this stack is **safe-by-default**: every example workload exposes an *internal-scheme* load balancer reachable only via `kubectl port-forward`. Nothing is published to the public internet without an explicit opt-in.

To expose the example workloads on a real domain over HTTPS, set `var.base_domain` (and optionally `var.subdomain`) to a public Route53 hosted zone you already own:

```bash
terraform apply -var='base_domain=example.com' -var='subdomain=automode'
```

When `base_domain` is set, Terraform will:

- Look up the existing public hosted zone (it does **not** create one — the zone must already exist and be the authoritative DNS for that name).
- Issue an ACM wildcard certificate `*.<subdomain>.<base_domain>` validated via DNS records added to the zone.
- Install [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) bound to a Pod Identity IAM role scoped to **only** that hosted zone (not `Route53FullAccess`).
- Switch the cluster-wide `IngressClass alb` to `internet-facing` with a shared ALB group so all example Ingresses share one load balancer.
- Render each example with a public hostname and the appropriate annotations.

Workload hostnames once enabled:

| Example | URL |
|---|---|
| `examples/graviton` | `https://2048-graviton.<full_domain>` |
| `examples/spot` | `https://2048-spot.<full_domain>` |
| `examples/gpu` | `http://gpu.<full_domain>` (NLB on :80) |
| `examples/neuron` | `http://whisper.<full_domain>` (NLB on :80) |

The ALB controller picks the right certificate via SNI from each Ingress's `host:` against the wildcard cert — no `certificateArn` is configured anywhere.

To revert to safe-by-default, unset `var.base_domain` and re-apply.

### 💾 EBS CSI Driver Configuration
EKS Auto Mode automates persistent storage setup with Amazon EBS:

1. 🔹 **Automated Storage Management**
   - No need to install the EBS CSI controller on EKS Auto Mode clusters
   - [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html)

2. 🔸 **Storage Classes and PVCs**
   - Native Kubernetes storage integration
   - Optimized for various workload requirements
   - Example: [Neuron Model Storage Class](/examples/neuron/pvc.yaml)

> **Important**: The EBS CSI driver requires specific IAM permissions to make calls to AWS APIs. EKS Auto Mode simplifies this setup, but you should be aware of the following:
> - Only platform versions created from a storage class using `ebs.csi.eks.amazonaws.com` as the provisioner can be mounted on nodes created by EKS Auto Mode
> - Existing platform versions must be migrated to the new storage class using a volume snapshot
> - For custom KMS key encryption, additional IAM permissions may be required

cd terraform

# Initialize and destroy infrastructure
terraform init
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This will delete all cluster resources. Make sure to back up any important data.

## Security Considerations
Our code is continuously scanned using [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/5.Policy%20Index/kubernetes.html). The following security considerations are documented for transparency:

|Checks	|Details	|Reasons	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|CKV_TF_1	|Ensure Terraform module sources use a commit hash	|For easy experimentation, we set version of module, instead of setting a commit hash. Consider implementing a commit hash in a production cluster. [Read more on why we need to set commit hash for modules here.](https://medium.com/boostsecurity/erosion-of-trust-unmasking-supply-chain-vulnerabilities-in-the-terraform-registry-2af48a7eb2)	|
|CKV2_K8S_6	|Minimize the admission of pods which lack an associated NetworkPolicy	|All Pod to Pod communication is allowed by default for easy experimentation in this project. Amazon VPC CNI now supports [Kubernetes Network Policies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-vpc-cni-now-supports-kubernetes-network-policies/) to secure network traffic in kubernetes clusters	|
|CKV_K8S_8	|Liveness Probe Should be Configured	|For easy experimentation, no health checks is to be performed against the container to determine whether it is alive or not. Consider implementing [health checks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) in a production cluster.	|
|CKV_K8S_9	|Readiness Probe Should be Configured	|For easy experimentation, no health checks is to be performed against the container to determine whether it is alive or not. Consider implementing health checks in a production cluster.	|
|CKV_K8S_22	|Use read-only filesystem for containers where possible	|We've made an exception for the workloads that requires are Read/Write file system. [Configure your images with read-only root file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/pod-security.html#_configure_your_images_with_read_only_root_file_system)	|
|CKV_K8S_23	|Minimize the admission of root containers	|This project uses default root container configurations for demonstration purposes. While this doesn't follow security best practices, it ensures compatibility with demo images. For production, configure runAsNonRoot: true and follow [guidance](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user) on building images with specified user ID.  	|
|CKV_K8S_37	|Minimize the admission of containers with capabilities assigned	|For easy experimentation, we've made exception for the workloads that requires added capability. For production purposes, we recommend [capabilities field](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/pod-security.html#_linux_capabilities) that allows granting certain privileges to a process without granting all the privileges of the root user.  	|
|CKV_K8S_40	|Containers should run as a high UID to avoid host conflict	|We've used publicly available container images in this project for customers' easy access. For test purposes, the container images user id are left intact. See [how to define UID](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).	|
